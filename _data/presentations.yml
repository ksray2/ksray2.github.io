  summary: "Health Informatics is a growing concentrated field within information technology, which bridges communications and healthcare to improve governance and safety of patient information. The challenge is for health educators to integrate emerging interactive technology efficiently to assure new information is relayed, received and applied by health informatics students to the dynamic genre system of health information. Since traditional lecturing methods fail to encompass the dynamic genre system of health information, research communicating the effectiveness of game science technology has moved to the fore. Gamification answers the argument of using interactive technology to create a personalized and cooperative learning environment that provides health informatics students relevant skills to better facilitate enculturation into the workplace. This study aims to evaluate the literature on gamification for adult and health informatics education, and the effectiveness of gamification experiences on the enculturation of graduate students into responsible and responsive health professionals. The evaluative framework of this study is Knowlesâ€™ Andragogy, the adult characteristic learning theory, from the perspective of Merriam and Bierema in Adult Learning: Linking Theory and Practice. I use this foundation as a divergent well-respected system that defined theoretical constructs, insights and understandings for educators and technical communicators over many generations. Three databases were used in the search: ERIC, PubMed and Summon. A total of 337 articles from electronic databases were identified. The final selection of 20 expert writings were the most illustrative of the topic. Results indicated gamification, as an educational technology, cooperated with the theoretical learning contributions of Malcolm Knowles, and was recognized as a resourceful and effectual concept to assist the next generation of health informatics professionals. But the literature only offers revisions to theory, with limited practical applications and less mentions of solutions. The neglect, in this regard, arises primarily from the lacking evidence-based documentation of the educational efficacy of gamification. Thus, I investigate how technical communicators can make an important contribution to the game development industry and why the field of technical communication gains from close involvement with the emerging industry of gamification technology. I discuss ethical concerns encompassed in technological instruction and suggest novel curriculum that empower students to propel beyond the zone of proximal development towards an adaptive and inclusive global health perspective."
