  summary: "Health Informatics is a growing concentrated field that bridges communications and healthcare to improve governance and safety of patient information. The challenge is for health educators to integrate emerging interactive technology efficiently to assure new information is relayed, received and applied by health informatics students to the dynamic genre system of health information. This study aims to evaluate the literature on gamification for adult and health informatics education, and the effectiveness of gamification experiences on the enculturation of graduate students into responsible and responsive health professionals. The evaluative framework of this study is Knowles’ Andragogy from the perspective of Merriam and Bierema in Adult Learning: Linking Theory and Practice. Lastly, I investigate how technical communicators can make an important contribution to the game development industry and why the field of technical communication gains from close involvement with the emerging industry of gamification technology."
